Piper Memory: Fabricated-knowledge validation content.

Real-world facts can never give an unambiguous signal for validating the
loss-delta learning-progress mechanism, because pretrained leakage can
never be ruled out - if performance improves, there's no way to know
whether the mechanism taught it or the model already half-knew it.
Fabricated facts about something that provably doesn't exist anywhere
else close that gap completely. Same logic as this project's shuffled-
pairing baselines and planted-rotation synthetic tests elsewhere - a
known-correct-by-construction case, to trust the measurement tool before
ever pointing it at something ambiguous.

Two entities: "warbles" (role "studied" - the thing the mechanism
actually gets to learn about) and "quaddles" (role "control" - facts
that exist here only to define probes, and must NEVER be fed to a study
step). Quaddles is deliberately opposite warbles on most traits
(solitary vs. social, swim vs. fly, dawn vs. dusk), so any contamination
between the two would show up as a wrong-direction answer, not just an
ambiguous "did it improve a little."

Two kinds of probe, matching the two-tier evaluation pattern already
used in train_reconstruction_adapter.py: recall_probes are
(prompt, target) continuation pairs, meant for the fast, quantitative
teacher-forced loss-delta measurement - the primary learning-progress
signal. generalization_probes are open questions with no single correct
continuation, meant for the slower, free-generation qualitative read
(does the answer actually integrate multiple studied facts, or just
recite one verbatim) - not part of the loss-delta computation.
