"""
Piper Memory: Teacher-forced loss measurement on recall probes.

The core "did studying this measurably help" signal. Deliberately not
tied to any particular way of changing the model's behavior - in-context
conditioning, LoRA fine-tuning, or nothing at all for a baseline
measurement - so the study mechanism can change later (see
obsidian/Journals/2026-09-10.md) without this needing to.

Simpler than train_adapter.py / train_reconstruction_adapter.py's loss
functions: there's no cross-model injection here, no forward hook, no
translation adapter - just a normal single forward pass on one model,
reading its own logits, scoring only the target continuation's tokens.
