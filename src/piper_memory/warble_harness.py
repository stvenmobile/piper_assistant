"""
Piper Memory: End-to-end sanity-check harness for the warble/quaddle
experiment.

This is a PLUMBING sanity check, not a test of genuine learning. The
"study" step here is in-context only (study facts placed directly in the
prompt before each probe) - already identified in
obsidian/Journals/2026-09-10.md as a near-trivial signal on its own: if
the facts are visible in context at measurement time, loss improving
mostly reflects ordinary reading comprehension, not anything persisted
in the model. What this DOES meaningfully verify: MemoryStore
population, real loss measurement against a real model, persistence
round-tripping, and that the quaddle control stays completely isolated
throughout - its own facts are never touched, only warbles' context gets
prepended to its probes, to check whether irrelevant context generically
helps prediction (it shouldn't, for facts it doesn't answer).

Genuine learning requires the LoRA path (not yet built).

Scoped down for this first pass: only SmallModelEmbedder populates
MemoryStore here, to avoid loading two separate copies of the same base
model (one via QwenHiddenStateEmbedder's own ResidualExtractor, one as
the model actually being measured). Adding the second embedding method
back in is a natural follow-up once this core plumbing is proven.
