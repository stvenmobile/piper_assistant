"""
Piper Memory: In-RAM, disk-persisted knowledge store.

A new, separate track from src/piper_geometry's cross-model work - see
obsidian/Journals/2026-09-10.md for the full design discussion. Built to
answer a specific need: a genuine learning-progress signal ("is studying
this topic measurably improving prediction, not just novel") requires a
history of repeated exposures to compute a trend from, and that history
has to survive process restarts to mean anything across sessions.

Deliberately NOT built on FAISS or any specialized vector index. At the
scale this is meant for (hundreds to low-thousands of items), brute-force
cosine similarity against an in-memory tensor is sub-millisecond - no
approximate-nearest-neighbor structure is needed, and keeping the whole
mechanism inside plain, inspectable code (rather than behind an external
library's own index format) was an explicit design choice, not just a
simplicity shortcut - see the "means of access" discussion in the journal.

Persistence is deliberately split rather than a single pickle: embeddings
via torch.save/load (matching every checkpoint in this project), metadata
(content, timestamps, loss history) as JSON (matching
concepts_dictionary.json and the journal frontmatter) - human-readable,
diffable, and robust to this class's shape changing over time, which
pickle is not.

MemoryStore represents only what has actually been learned and retained.
Test/control material (e.g. a fictional entity deliberately never
studied) must never be added here - it belongs in a separate, static
test-definition file the evaluation harness reads directly, so a
negative control stays a negative control by construction.
