Piper Memory: LoRA fine-tuning - the genuine "study" step.

Where the in-context "study" in warble_harness.py just placed facts in
the prompt (and was shown, with real numbers, to produce a confounded
signal - see obsidian/Journals/2026-09-11.md), this actually changes the
model's own behavior via a small set of trained weights, so a COLD
post-study measurement (no facts anywhere in the prompt) becomes
possible - the only way to rule out generic context-priming and get a
signal that reflects persistent, fact-specific learning.

Via HuggingFace's peft library: freeze the base model entirely (exactly
as every cross-model experiment in this project already does), inject
small trainable low-rank matrices alongside the attention q_proj/v_proj
layers instead of training them directly. The base model's own weights
never change at all - the result is base-model-plus-a-swappable-adapter,
non-destructive by construction, the same pattern
train_adapter.TranslationAdapter already used for a different purpose.

target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"] is the standard, most common minimal
LoRA configuration - confirmed against this project's actual model
architecture (Qwen2's attention block) rather than assumed from memory.
