"""
Piper Memory: Embedding methods, run side by side.

Two candidates, compared empirically rather than settled on paper - see
obsidian/Journals/2026-09-10.md. A dedicated small sentence-embedding
model is purpose-built for retrieval (trained via contrastive learning so
cosine similarity directly reflects semantic relevance). Reusing Qwen's
own hidden states (via the same ResidualExtractor machinery
src/piper_geometry's cross-model work already validated) is a repurposed
by-product of a next-token-prediction objective instead - real, measured
structure exists there, but with the well-earned low confidence about any
single layer that project's cross-model work already surfaced.

Both expose the same embed(text) -> torch.Tensor interface, so code that
populates MemoryStore can treat them uniformly without caring which one
it's using.
